Can you add a scene that changes color based on weather?
Iâ€™d like the bulbs to automatically pulse to my music.
"Please support grouping lights by activity (e.g. reading, cooking)."
Could you add a feature that automatically adjusts bulb color based on outside weather?
can you add dark mode in it?,
could you add backlit feature in that smart bulb of yours?,1234
