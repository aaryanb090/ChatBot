question: 'Can I create a Perifo setup that has multiple power supply units so that I can power more than 100 W of lights?'
---

Perifo was designed to work with a single power supply unit. Using more than one PSU is not supported. If you want to create a setup of more than 100 W (or 90 W in the United States and Canada), use two separate setups placed next to, but not connected to, each other.
