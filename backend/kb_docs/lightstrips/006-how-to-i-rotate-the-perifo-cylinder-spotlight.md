question: 'How to I rotate the Perifo cylinder spotlight?'
---

Perifo cylinder spotlights can be rotated 350 degrees to shine light where you need it. Itâ€™s simple to do: hold the light and turn it clockwise or counterclockwise. Note that the spotlight does not fully rotate 360 degrees, as there is a stopping point at the base of the light.
