question: 'Can I mount the ceiling power supply unit to the wall or the wall power supply unit to the ceiling?'
---

Yes. Though the power supply units were designed for either the wall or ceiling, if you have an electrical box on your wall, you can use the ceiling power supply unit. Conversely, if you have a wall outlet on your ceiling, you can use the wall power supply unit.
