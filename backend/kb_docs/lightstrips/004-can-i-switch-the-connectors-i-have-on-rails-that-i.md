question: "Can I switch the connectors I have on rails that I have already installed with the flexible connector?"
---

Yes! Before you start, turn the electricity powering the fixture off. Remove the rail cover, and loosen the screws so that the rail can move around slightly. Place the connector into place, and tighten the screws on the rail. Place the connector into the second rail, and install it as shown in the manual.
