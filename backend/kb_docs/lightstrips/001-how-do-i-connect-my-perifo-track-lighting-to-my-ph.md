question: 'How do I connect my Perifo track lighting to my Philips Hue smart lighting system?'
---

Perifo lights work like all other Philips Hue lights, meaning you can add them right in the Hue app. You can find information on connecting Perifo to your Philips Hue system on the [How to connect] page for lamps.
