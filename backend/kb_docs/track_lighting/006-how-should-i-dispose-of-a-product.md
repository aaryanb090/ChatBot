question: 'How should I dispose of a product?'
---

Your product is designed and manufactured with high-quality materials and components, which can be recycled and reused.
Learn your local waste disposal requirements, as well as the separation and collection system for electrical and electronic products and packaging. Please act according to your local rules and do not dispose of your old product and packaging with your normal household waste.
Batteries should be disposed of separately from the municipal waste stream via designated collection facilities. When disposing of a product that contains non-user replaceable batteries, the non-user replaceable batteries shall be removed by a professional.
