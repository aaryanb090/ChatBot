question: 'How can I tell if a bulb is the new "richer color" version?'
---

Newer versions of Philips Hue bulbs feature “richer colors,” meaning that the bulbs have deeper greens and blues to more consistently match the colors of the Philips Hue Go and lightstrip. You can identify all richer color bulbs by their white base, with the exception of the BR30 bulb. The older BR30 bulb features a gray rim, while the richer color version does not.
When purchasing new products, you can identify richer color bulbs by their packaging: the packaging features a round green label in the top right corner with the text “richer colors.”
