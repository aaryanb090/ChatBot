question: 'Can I use different types of standalone Hue fixtures together?'
---

Yes. All Philips Hue light fixtures are fully compatible with the Hue ecosystem. Some can be used as standalone light fixtures, while others require a Hue Bridge in order to operate. However, all Hue products can connect to a Bridge for advanced control via the Hue app.
