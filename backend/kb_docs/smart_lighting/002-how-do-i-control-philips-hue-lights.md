question: 'How do I control Philips Hue lights?'
---

You can control Philips Hue lights multiple ways — that's one of the reasons they're so smart!
The Philips Hue app: You can set up and control your lights in the app, where you can turn them on and off, dim or brighten the room, group lights into Rooms and Zones, set up automations, and more.
Voice: You can also control your lights with your voice when you connect Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Home & Siri. Go to Settings > Voice assistants to set it up.
Smart accessories: Adding Philips Hue smart accessories, such as the Tap dial switch or the smart button, to your setup gives you even more control over your lights. Cycle through your favorite scenes, use each accessory as a remote control from anywhere in the house, or even get the best light for each time of the day with the press of a button — get as creative as you like!
