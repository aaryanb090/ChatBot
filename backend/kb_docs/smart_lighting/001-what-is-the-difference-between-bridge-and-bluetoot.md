question: 'What is the difference between Bridge and Bluetooth?'
---

When it comes to controlling Philips Hue lights, there are two options: using a Bridge or Bluetooth.
With a Bridge, you get Out of home control, which means you can control your lights from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. You can also add up to 50 lights and accessories, add outdoor lighting, and create automations.
With Bluetooth, you can control up to 10 lights in a single room. You can create a single automation (called a routine), but it will only occur once.
Even if you have Philips Hue bulbs or lights that you’re using with Bluetooth, you can always switch to a Bridge — they’ll all still work.
