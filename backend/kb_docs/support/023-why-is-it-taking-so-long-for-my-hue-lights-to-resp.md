question: 'Why is it taking so long for my hue lights to respond?'
---

There are multiple ways for your app to control the hue system. The hue API is a RESTful interface, which can be accessed by many languages. In addition, we provide SDKs for IOS, OSX, Java multi-platform and Android. Third party developers have created a number of other tools and SDKs for different languages. Refer to hue API documentation, IOS and OSX SDK, Java multi-platform and Android SDK, list of third party SDKs and tools
