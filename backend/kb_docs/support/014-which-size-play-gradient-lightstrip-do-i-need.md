question: 'Which size Play gradient lightstrip do I need?'
---

For TVs, we have three sizes of Play gradient lightstrips: made for 55”, 65”, or 75” TVs. For monitors, we also have three sizes: made for single 24–27” monitors, made for single 32–34” monitors, and made for 24–27” triple-monitor setups. If you have a different size TV or monitor, we recommend getting a Play gradient lightstrip that is slightly smaller than your TV or monitor. Because the lightstrip is bright, it does not matter if it does not reach the corners on the back of the TV or the monitor.
If you have a TV smaller than 50” or a monitor smaller than 24”, we recommend using Philips Hue Play light bars instead.
