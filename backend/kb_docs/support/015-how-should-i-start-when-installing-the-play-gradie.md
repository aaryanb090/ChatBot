question: 'How should I start when installing the Play gradient lightstrip?'

You can find all the instructions in the Philips Hue app! Add the light to your Philips Hue system first in the app, which will give you step-by-step instructions on the physical installation.
You can also follow the instructions in the manual or watch the how-to video for TV installation.
