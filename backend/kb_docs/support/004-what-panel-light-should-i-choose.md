question: 'What panel light should I choose?'
---

It depends! We have a wide variety of LED panels, with different sizes, shapes, colors, light color, and usage area.
For beautiful light effects and sleek design, Datura is a good choice. It offers two independently controllable light sources, the main light and its backlight. Because of this — along with its sleek, slim aluminum frame — it’s both a beautiful decorative ceiling lamp and functional overhead light.
For a similarly sleek design in more shapes and sizes, choose Aurelle (color light) or Surimu (warm-to-cool white light). These panel lights also feature a sleek aluminum frame.
For ceiling panels in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, Tento is a good option. They’re available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, as well as in White, White ambiance, or White and color ambiance. Tento features a synthetic frame in black or white.
