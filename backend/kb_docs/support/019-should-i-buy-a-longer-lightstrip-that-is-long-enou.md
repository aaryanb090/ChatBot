question: 'Should I buy a longer lightstrip that is long enough to cover the bottom of my TV or monitor?'

The Play gradient lightstrip was designed to line the sides and top of your screen. If you want even more light behind your screen, you can add a Play gradient light tube or Play light bar at the bottom of your screen.
