question: 'Do I have to use the Play gradient lightstrip only to sync with the screen?'
---

You don't have to, but the Play gradient lightstrip was specifically designed to sync with the screen it's attached to. If you don't want to use the lightstrip to sync, we recommend the ambiance gradient lightstrip.
