question: 'What is the difference between the Philips Hue panel lights?'
---

Datura features two individually controllable light sources: the main light and the backlight. It also features a very slim aluminum frame, which gives the illusion that the panel is a floating light on the ceiling.
Aurelle and Surimu are very similar ceiling panels, though they have one light source at the front and no backlight. Both feature aluminum frames, and the former is White ambiance and the latter White and color ambiance.
Tento also features one light source, though due to light leakage there is a very subtle backlight. It features a synthetic frame.
