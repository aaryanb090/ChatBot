question: 'Can I connect different Philips Hue lightstrip types to each other?'
---

Because of their internal electronics, all Philips Hue lightstrips that can be extended can only be used with lightstrips of the same type. For example, you can extend lightstrip Plus with another Plus extension, but not with an ambiance gradient lightstrip extension and vice versa.
If you have older versions of the original lightstrip, they may not be compatible with the current version.
