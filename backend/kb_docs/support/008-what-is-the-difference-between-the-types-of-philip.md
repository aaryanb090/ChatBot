question: 'What is the difference between the types of Philips Hue lightstrip?'
---

There are five types of Philips Hue lightstrips:
Philips Hue lightstrip Plus produces one color at a time. It comes as a 2-meter length with its own power supply. It can be cut to size or extended up to 10 meters with 1-meter extensions. Ideal for accent light and highlighting architectural features of unique sizes.
Philips Hue Solo lightstrip produces one color at a time. It comes in 3-meter, 5-meter, and 10-meter lengths with its own power supply. It can be cut to size, but not extended. Ideal for covering longer surfaces, such as along hallways, ceilings, or stairs.
Philips Hue ambiance gradient lightstrip produces multiple colors of light at the same time. It comes as a 2-meter length with power supply. It can be cut to size or extended up to 10 m with 1-meter extensions. Because you can set a scene with multiple colors on a single fixture, it’s ideal for decorative accents.
Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrip for TV produces multiple colors of light at the same time. Designed to be mounted behind a TV, it comes in three lengths, based on TV size: 55-inch, 65-inch, or 75-inch.
Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrip for PC produces multiple colors of light at the same time. Designed to be mounted behind a monitor, it comes in three lengths, based on monitor size: 24–27 inch, 32–34 inch, or three 24–27 inch for triple-monitor setups.
