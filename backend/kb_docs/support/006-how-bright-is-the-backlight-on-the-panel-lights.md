question: 'How bright is the backlight on the panel lights?'
---

It depends on the panel light. Datura has an individually controllable backlight, so it offers significantly more light than the other panels. Tentoâ€™s backlight is due to light leakage from the main light, so it is not as bright as Datura. Aurelle and Surimu do not feature a backlight.
