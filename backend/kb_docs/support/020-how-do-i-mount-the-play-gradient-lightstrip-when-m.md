question: 'How do I mount the Play gradient lightstrip when my monitor differs from the sizes listed on the lightstrip’s packaging?'
---

If your monitor is bigger than 24–27 in or 32–34 in, you can still use the Play gradient lightstrip. The distance between the edge of the monitor and the outside of the mounts should ideally follow the list below, but you can adjust the placement of the mounts so that the lightstrip sits closer to the center of your monitor:
24" monitor: 2.5 cm
27" monitor:  6.5 cm
32" monitor: 5 cm
34" monitor: 6.5 cm
Three 24" monitors: 4.5 cm
Three 27" monitors: 7 cm
